## Why React.js?
I used React.js library for this task because of many reasons. The most important would be my will to learn and even master this library for future project development, so this task was an excellent opportunity to train my skills and learn new secrets while working with this tool. Another reason would be the simplicity of managing state and data using this library. I was able to manage asynchronous processes without headaches as it would have been using vanilla JS or even HTML. So my choice of using this tool was mostly because of its easily managable state and the motivation-driven will for mastering React.js!
